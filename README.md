# RugGuard

![RugGuard Logo](chrome-extension/images/icon-128.png)

RugGuard is a browser extension that provides real-time Solana token security analysis directly in your browser. It automatically checks token risk when you visit popular Solana DEX platforms and warns you about potentially fraudulent tokens.

## Features

### üîç Automatic Token Detection
RugGuard automatically detects token addresses from URLs as you browse Solana DEX platforms like Raydium, Meteora, Pump.fun, and Fluxbeam.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-Time Risk Assessment
Receive instant token security assessments with clear risk levels: Safe, Warning, or Danger.

### üëÄ Token Watchlist
Add tokens to your watchlist and get notified when their risk level changes, even when you're not actively viewing them.

### üîî Desktop Notifications
Receive desktop notifications when tokens in your watchlist become more risky, allowing you to take action quickly.

### üìù Token History
Keep track of tokens you've previously checked and their risk status.

## Supported Platforms

- Raydium.io
- Meteora.ag
- Pump.fun
- Fluxbeam.xyz
- RugCheck.xyz

## Installation

### Chrome
1. Download the extension from our website
2. Unzip the file
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode"

## How It Works

1. RugGuard runs silently in the background while you browse Solana DEX platforms
2. When a token address is detected, it's automatically checked using the RugCheck API
3. If a risky token is found, a warning popup appears with detailed risk information
4. Safe tokens are discreetly confirmed with a small notification
5. Add tokens to your watchlist for continuous monitoring

## Privacy

RugGuard only accesses data on supported DEX websites to extract token addresses. Your browsing data is not collected or shared with any third parties.

## Development

This project consists of:
- Chrome/Firefox browser extension (in `/chrome-extension`)
- Web demo and landing page (in `/client`)
- Backend API server (in `/server`)
